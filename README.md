# What Is a Token?

Before diving into tokenomics, let's take a look at what a token means. 

A token is a digital unit of a cryptocurrency that are used as a specific asset or to represent a particular use on the blockchain. 

Tokens have multiple use cases, but the most common are as security, utility and governance tokens.


# Tokenomics

Tokenomics is a term that captures a token’s economics. 

It describes the factors that impact a token’s use and value, including but not limited to the token’s creation and distribution, supply and demand, incentive mechanisms, and token burn schedules. 

For crypto projects, well-designed tokenomics is critical to success. 

Assessing a project’s tokenomics before deciding to participate is essential for investors and stakeholders.

A portmanteau of “token” and “economics,” tokenomics is a catch-all for the elements that make a particular cryptocurrency valuable and interesting to investors. 

That includes everything from a token’s supply and how it’s issued to things like what utility it has.

Tokenomics is an important concept to consider when making an investment decision because ultimately a project that has smart and well-designed incentives to buy and hold tokens for the long haul is more likely to outlast and do better than a project that hasn't built an ecosystem around its token. 

A well-built platform often translates into higher demand over time as new investors flock to the project, which, in turn, boosts prices.

# Core features of tokenomics

Tokenomics determine two things about a crypto economy – the incentives that set out how the token will be distributed and the utility of the tokens that influence its demand. 

Supply and demand has a huge impact on price, and projects that get the incentives right can surge in value.

# 1 Mining and staking 

For base layer blockchains, like Ethereum 1.0 and Bitcoin, mining is the core incentive for a decentralized network of computers to validate transactions.

Here, new tokens are given to those who devote their computing power to discovering new blocks, filling them with data and adding them to the blockchain.

Staking rewards those who fulfil a similar role but by locking away a number of coins in a smart contract instead – this is how blockchains like Tezos operate, and it’s the model that Ethereum’s moving toward with its 2.0 upgrade.

# 2 Yields

Decentralized finance platforms offer high yields to incentivize people to buy and stake tokens. 

Tokens are staked in liquidity pools – huge pools of cryptocurrencies that power things like decentralized exchanges and lending platforms. 

These yields are paid out in the form of new tokens.

# 3 Token burns 

Some blockchains or protocols "burn" tokens – permanently remove them from circulation – to reduce the supply of coins in circulation. 

According to the laws of supply and demand, reducing a token’s supply should help to support its price as the remaining tokens in circulation become more scarce. 

In August 2021, Ethereum started to burn a portion of tokens sent as transaction fees instead of sending them to miners.

# 4 Limited vs unlimited supplies 

Tokenomics determines a token’s maximum supply. 

Bitcoin’s tokenomics, for instance, dictates that no more than 21 million coins can ever be mined, with the last coin expected to enter circulation around the year 2140. 

Ethereum, by contrast, has no maximum limit, although its issuance each year is capped. 

NFT (non-fungible token) projects take scarcity to the extreme; some collections might mint only a single NFT for a piece of art.

#5 Token allocations and vesting periods 

Some crypto projects account for a detailed distribution of tokens. 

Often, a certain number of tokens are reserved for venture capitalists or developers, but the catch is that they can sell those tokens only after a certain time. 

That naturally has an effect on the circulating supply of the coin over time. 

Ideally, a project’s team will have implemented a system where tokens are distributed in such a way that it reduces the impact to the circulating supply and a token’s price as much as possible.

# 6 Total Supply.

What Is The Total Bitcoin Supply?

In total, there will be just 21 million Bitcoin produced. The total Bitcoin supply will be reached around 2140. 

Until then, the number of new coins that are created via the mining process will decrease by half, roughly every four years. This is known as the Bitcoin halving and was designed to create what economists call scarcity, therefore providing upwards pressure on prices. 

While 21 million of total Bitcoin supply may sound like a very large number, when compared to the 8 billion or so people on earth, it is obviously incredibly small. It is this imbalance that leads many people to compare Bitcoin to gold and think of it as “hard” money. 

# 7 Circulating supply

Dogecoin and Grin Circulating Supply

However, there are coins whose schedule is very different. For example, both Dogecoin and Grin have issuance that is identical for every new block created forever, which means that their token supply is essentially unlimited.

Dogecoin circulating supply is currently 131.13 billion as of September 2021, with no fixed maximum supply. It has an inflationary supply, instead of a deflationary one like Bitcoin. Proponents of Dogecoin, which include high profile billionaires, argue that this tokenomics is what makes it a usable currency.

The founders of Grin hope that this feature will make it easier to maintain a stable price and thus become a more usable currency. It will take years to understand whether this actually happens.

In between these two positions are plenty of coins and a lot of tokens — many operating on Ethereum — that have a maximum issuance in place, but that number is very high. For example, Tron has a total supply capped at more than 100 billion.

There are also situations where the number of coins or tokens will reduce. Some projects have created rules in which a certain number will be burned — which means that they will be transferred into a wallet that cannot be recovered — at set intervals. Burning usually relates to operating fees, so that the more an asset is used, the faster its tokens are burned.


# Tokenomics in Determining Cryptocurrency Value

‍Tokenomics is also helpful as guidance to understand how much an asset might be worth in the future. 

For example, many people new to crypto will think something like, “If this coin becomes as valuable as Bitcoin, then one day…” while in reality it might never be possible. 

As an example, let’s think of two coins mentioned above, Bitcoin Cash and Tron. 

Bitcoin Cash has the same total supply as Bitcoin, so thinking that one may become as valuable as the other in time has some legitimacy — it is possible. However, with more than 100 billion Tron existing, for one coin to be valued in the thousands of dollars, Tron would need to become the most valuable business in the history of the world — how likely is that to happen?

# Why Is Tokenomics Important When Investing in Cryptocurrency?

In his famous investment book, Margin of Safety, value investing legend Seth Klarman explains that, “In the short run supply and demand alone determine market prices.” 

If we believe that to be true and that it applies to cryptoassets using blockchain technology as well as the stock market, then understanding the factors that will impact either supply or demand are of vital importance to both speculators and investors.

In which case, there are a number of factors to consider when looking at crypto tokenomics. 

Perhaps the most important is to understand how the digital currency will be used. Is there a clear link between usage of the platform or service being built and the asset? If there is, there is a strong chance that a growing service will require purchases and usage that ultimately helps to increase the price. If there is not, what can the token be used for?


Other important questions to answer include the following: 

- How many coins or tokens currently exist? 
- How many will exist in the future and when will they be created? 
- Who owns the coins? Are there some set aside to be released in the future to developers? 
- Is there any information to suggest that a large number of coins has been lost, burned, deleted or are somehow unusable?

While these questions may seem to require complex answers, they will provide an extra way to view cryptoassets and help to understand whether one asset is more likely to have a great future than another. 

As the first crypto to be created, the issuance process and schedule of Bitcoin has led the way for others. For example, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV and Zcash also have a hard cap of 21 million coins. Others, such as Litecoin, use the same framework but have a larger overall number.
